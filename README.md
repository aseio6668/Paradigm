# Paradigm (PAR) Cryptocurrency

## Overview
Paradigm is a revolutionary cryptocurrency that replaces traditional mining with machine learning-based consensus and computational contributions. The network incentivizes users to contribute computational power for ML tasks, autonomous agents, and oracle services.

## Key Features
- **No Premine**: Fair launch with AI-governed distribution
- **ML-Based Consensus**: Rewards for computational contributions instead of mining
- **Near-Instant Transactions**: Timestamp-based synchronization
- **Autonomous Governance**: AI-controlled reward distribution
- **Smart Contracts & Oracles**: Built-in support for autonomous agents
- **Evolving Network**: Self-improving through ML contributions

## Technical Specifications
- **Currency Symbol**: PAR
- **Decimal Precision**: 8 decimals
- **Initial Supply**: 8,000,000,000 PAR
- **First Year Distribution**: 1,000,000,000 PAR (AI-governed)
- **Transaction Speed**: Near-instant
- **Network Type**: Peer-to-peer with ML task coordination
