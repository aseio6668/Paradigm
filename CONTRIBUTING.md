# Contributing to Paradigm Cryptocurrency

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Paradigm! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Code Contributions

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes and write tests
4. Ensure all tests pass: `cargo test`
5. Format your code: `cargo fmt`
6. Run clippy: `cargo clippy`
7. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
8. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

### 2. ML Task Contributions

Paradigm's unique feature is its ML-based consensus. You can contribute by:

- Implementing new ML task processors
- Improving existing algorithms
- Adding new task types for the network
- Optimizing performance

### 3. Documentation

- Improve existing documentation
- Add examples and tutorials
- Write API documentation
- Create user guides

### 4. Testing

- Write unit tests
- Add integration tests
- Test on different platforms
- Report bugs and issues

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- Git
- SQLite3
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paradigm-crypto/paradigm.git
cd paradigm
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test --all
```

### Code Style

We use `rustfmt` for code formatting and `clippy` for linting:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Security First**: All cryptographic operations must be secure
2. **Performance**: Optimize for near-instant transactions
3. **Scalability**: Design for network growth
4. **Modularity**: Keep components loosely coupled
5. **ML Integration**: Seamlessly integrate ML tasks

### Component Structure

- `paradigm-core`: Core blockchain and network logic
- `paradigm-wallet`: User-friendly GUI wallet
- `paradigm-contributor`: ML task contributor client
- `paradigm-web`: Web interface and API
- `paradigm-contracts`: Smart contract engine
- `paradigm-agents`: Autonomous agent framework

## ML Task Development

When creating new ML task processors:

1. Implement the `TaskProcessor` trait
2. Handle different difficulty levels
3. Provide accurate capability reporting
4. Include comprehensive tests
5. Document expected input/output formats

Example:

```rust
#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl TaskProcessor for MyProcessor {
    async fn process(&mut self, data: &[u8], difficulty: u8) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
        // Your ML processing logic here
    }

    fn get_capabilities(&self) -> TaskCapabilities {
        TaskCapabilities {
            max_difficulty: 10,
            estimated_time_per_unit: Duration::from_millis(100),
            memory_requirement: 256 * 1024 * 1024,
            gpu_required: false,
        }
    }
}
```

## Consensus Algorithm

Paradigm uses a unique ML-based consensus where:

1. Contributors submit computational work for ML tasks
2. AI governance distributes rewards based on contribution quality
3. Network synchronization uses timestamp-based data chunks
4. Fast sync allows quick client bootstrapping

## Security Guidelines

- Never hardcode private keys or sensitive data
- Use secure random number generation
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Follow cryptographic best practices
- Regularly audit dependencies

## Performance Guidelines

- Profile code before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize memory allocations
- Leverage async/await for I/O
- Consider SIMD optimizations for ML tasks

## Documentation Standards

- Use Rust doc comments (`///`)
- Provide examples for public APIs
- Document error conditions
- Include performance characteristics
- Keep README files up to date

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all public APIs
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use property-based testing where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Test on multiple platforms

## Issue Reporting

When reporting issues:

1. Use a clear, descriptive title
2. Provide steps to reproduce
3. Include system information
4. Attach relevant logs
5. Mention expected vs actual behavior

## Feature Requests

For feature requests:

1. Explain the use case
2. Describe the proposed solution
3. Consider alternatives
4. Estimate implementation effort
5. Discuss potential impact

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help newcomers get started
- Share knowledge and resources
- Follow the code of conduct
- Collaborate constructively
